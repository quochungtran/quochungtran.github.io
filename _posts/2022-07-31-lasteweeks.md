In my final weeks of the Google Summer of Code 2022, I spend my time polishing code and writing and documenting all parts of my code for the final Submission for final integration into the branch master.

To summarize, I would like to demo the functionalities of the Digikam OCR tool what I have done:


1: The user can process OCR in multiple documented images by selecting them; if not, a pop-up will appear 

2: There are four options that users can choose from based on 4 Tesseract basic options 

3: When the User clicks the button "Start OCR," The batch process will begin, it finishes while 100% in the progress bar, and all details of results are displayed in the Text Editor by double click on the item 

4: With the support of the spell-checking engine, users can adjust the text and store it in separate text files or XMP metadata by clicking on the "Save" button. 

5: The text is stored in XMP can translate to another language in storing on another place.
